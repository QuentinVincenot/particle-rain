# Particle rain

This personal project is a short adaptation of the falling particles simulation tutorial provided by [Franks laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrJh8-Ixnu8)'s video. The application is completely developped thanks to native Javascript canvas functionalities.

Particles are generated with random colors, positions, weights and directions. Their speed increase little by little during the fall until they touch the canvas bottom. They are programmed to bounce a single time once they reach it, then disappear when they reach the canvas bottom a second time.

The application is published thanks to Github Pages and is available at this address :
