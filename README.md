# Particle rain

This personal project is a short tutorial execution on falling particles simulation provided by [Franks laboratory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrJh8-Ixnu8)'s video. The application is completely developped thanks to native Javascript canvas functionalities.

The application is published thanks to Github Pages and is available at this address :
[Particle rain](https://quentinvincenot.github.io/particle-rain/)

You can find under a handmade GIF of the resulting application and website :
